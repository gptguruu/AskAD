Overview

AskAD is an intelligent data query system based on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), open-sourced by the DataEase team.

With AskAD, users can perform conversational data analysis (ChatBI), quickly extract insights, generate visual charts, and further conduct intelligent data exploration—all through natural language interaction.

Core Advantages

Out-of-the-box Experience
Simply configure the LLM and data source—no complex development required. Leveraging the LLM’s natural language understanding and SQL generation capabilities combined with RAG, SQLBot delivers high-quality Text-to-SQL conversion.

Secure and Controllable
Workspace-level resource isolation ensures clear data boundaries and secure access. Fine-grained permission control enhances governance and guarantees compliance throughout usage.

Easy Integration
Supports multiple integration methods, including web embedding, popup embedding, and MCP invocation. SQLBot can be seamlessly integrated into applications such as n8n, Dify, MaxKB, and DataEase, enabling intelligent data querying across platforms.

Continuously Improving Accuracy
Supports custom prompts, terminology libraries, and SQL example calibration for precise business alignment. With continuous optimization driven by user interaction data, the system becomes more accurate over time—the more you ask, the better it gets.
